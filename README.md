This multi-page website helped me master the excellent Wordpress CMS. Full page with CMS is on my local server. Unfortunately GitHub does not allow to place a dynamic page or I was a noob on creation moment this pageðŸ˜…

For this website i used the next technologies:
- HTML5 (semantic layout);
- SVG;
- CSS3:
  - Flex-box;
  - Grid-css;
  - Media queries;
  - SCSS;
  - Cross-browser layout;
- JavaScript:
  - jQuery;
  - Slick slider;
  - Gulp;
- Wordpress & PHP:
  - Carbon Fields.

For this page i made a lot great things like: 
- pagination; 
- searching by blog articles; 
- custom post types;
- custom taxonomies;
- output posts from WP_query;
- template hierarchy;
- wp plugins.
